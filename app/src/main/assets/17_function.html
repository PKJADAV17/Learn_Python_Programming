<p>A function is a block of code that performs a particular task. There are some situations when we need to write a particular block of code for more than once in our program. This may lead to bugs and irritation for the programmer.

<p>Python provides an approach in which you need to declare and define a group of statements once and that can be called and used whenever required. This saves both time and space.
