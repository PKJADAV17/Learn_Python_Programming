<div class="subhead1">Interpreter</div>
<ul>
<li>Translates program one statement at a time.</li>
<li>It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the
overall execution time is slower.</li>
<li>No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory
efficient</li>
<li>Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in
which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy.</li>
<li>Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters.</li>

<div class="subhead1">Compiler</div>
<ul>
<li>Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into
machine code.</li>
<li>It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the
overall execution time is comparatively faster.</li>
<li>Generates intermediate object code which further requires
linking, hence requires more memory.
</li>
<li>It generates the error message only after scanning the whole
program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard.</li>
<li>Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.</li>

<div class="subhead1">Machine level Programming</div>
<p>Imagine them as the “native tongue” of the computer, the
language closest to the hardware itself. Each unique computer has a
unique machine language. A machine language program is made up
of a series of binary patterns (e.g., 01011100) which represent
simple operations that can be accomplished by the computer (e.g.,
add two operands, move data to a memory location). Machine
language programs are executable, meaning that they can be run
directly. Programming in machine language requires memorization
of the binary codes and can be difficult for the human programmer.</p>

<hr class="new3">
<div class="subhead1">Assembly level Programming</div>
<p>They represent an effort to make programming easier for the
human. The machine language instructions are replaced with
simple pneumonic abbreviations (e.g., ADD, MOV). Thus
assembly languages are unique to a specific computer (machine).
Prior to execution, an assembly language program requires
translation to machine language. This translation is accomplished
by a computer program known as an Assembler. Assemblers are
written for each unique machine language.</p>

<hr class="new3">
<div class="subhead1">High level Programming</div>
<p>High-level languages, like C,C++, JAVA etc., are more
English-like and, therefore, make it easier for programmers to
“think” in the programming language. High-level languages also
require translation to machine language before execution. This
translation is accomplished by either a compiler or an interpreter.
Compilers translate the entire source code program before
execution. Interpreters translate source code programs one line at a
time. Interpreters are more interactive than compilers.</p>
