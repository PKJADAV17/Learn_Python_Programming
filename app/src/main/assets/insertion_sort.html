<div class="head">Insertion Sort</div>
<p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly-sorted lists, and often is used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the arrayâ€™s space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one.
