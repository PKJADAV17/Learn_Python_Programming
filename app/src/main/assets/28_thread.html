<div class="head">Multithreaded Programming</div>
<p>A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Also, it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS (Operating System).
</p>
<p>In simple words, a thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process!
</p>
<ul>
<li>For a single process, multiple threads can be used to process and share the same data-space and can communicate with each other by sharing information.
</li>
<li>They use lesser memory overhead, and hence they are called lightweight processes.
</li>
<li>A program can remain responsive to input when threads are used.</li>
<li>Threads can share and process the global variable's memory.</li>
</ul>
