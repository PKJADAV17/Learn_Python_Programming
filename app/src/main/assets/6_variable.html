<p>In most of the programming languages a variable is a named
location used to store data in the memory. Each variable must have
a unique name called identifier. It is helpful to think of variables
as container that hold data which can be changed later throughout
programming.

type of variable, different data types like integers, decimals,
characters, etc. can be stored in these variables.
