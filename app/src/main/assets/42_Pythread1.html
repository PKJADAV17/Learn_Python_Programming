            <div class='subhead1'>Threading Module</div>
            <p>Python's threading module provides a way to create and manage threads. You can create a new thread by creating an instance of the Thread class and providing a function to be executed in that thread.</p>
            <p> Here's a simple example using the threading module in Python. In this example, we'll create two threads that print messages concurrently.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        time.sleep(1)  
        print(f"Thread 1: {i}")

def print_letters():
    for letter in 'ABCDE':
        time.sleep(1)  
        print(f"Thread 2: {letter}")

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Main thread continues")</code></pre>
            <button onClick=myFunction()>Try it</button>
            <div class="subhead">Output</div>
            <div id="demo" class="output">
                Click on try it to see output
            </div>
            <ul><li>In this example We define two functions, <b>print_numbers</b> and <b>print_letters</b>, which simulate some work with a delay using <b>time.sleep(1)</b>.</li><li>Two threads, <b>thread1</b> and <b>thread2</b>, are created with these functions as their target.</li><li>The <b>start</b> method is called on each thread to initiate their execution.</li><li>The <b>join</b> method is used to wait for both threads to complete before the main thread continues.</li></ul>
            <p>Keep in mind that due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, threads might not provide as much parallelism as you would expect, especially in CPU-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, you might consider using the multiprocessing module to leverage multiple processes.</p>

            <div class='subhead1'>Thread Lifecycle</div>
            <p>A thread goes through various states during its lifecycle, including start, run, join, and terminate. The start method initiates the execution of the thread, and the run method contains the code to be executed in the thread. The join method is used to wait for the thread to complete its execution.</p>
            <p>Here's an example that illustrates the basic lifecycle of a thread using the threading module in Python.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">import threading
import time

def print_lifecycle_state(thread_name, state):
    print(f"{thread_name} is in {state} state")

def thread_function():
    print_lifecycle_state(threading.current_thread().name, "created")

    time.sleep(2)  

    print_lifecycle_state(threading.current_thread().name, "running")

    time.sleep(2)  

    print_lifecycle_state(threading.current_thread().name, "blocked")

    time.sleep(2)  

    print_lifecycle_state(threading.current_thread().name, "running")

    time.sleep(2)  

    print_lifecycle_state(threading.current_thread().name, "terminated")

my_thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, name="MyThread")

my_thread.start()

my_thread.join()

print("Main thread continues")</code></pre>
            <button onClick=myFunction1()>Try it</button>
            <div class="subhead">Output</div>
            <div id="demo1" class="output">
                Click on try it to see output
            </div>
            <ul><li>In this example The <b>print_lifecycle_state</b> function is used to print the current state of a thread.</li><li>The <b>thread_function</b> represents the main function that the thread will execute.</li><li>The main thread creates a new thread (<b>my_thread</b>), starts it, and then waits for it to complete.</li></ul>
            <p>This output reflects the basic lifecycle states of a thread like as follows.</p>
            <ul><li><strong>Created:</strong> The thread is created but not yet started.</li><li><strong>Running:</strong> The thread is actively executing its target function.</li><li><strong>Blocked:</strong> The thread is blocked, possibly waiting for a resource or sleeping.</li><li><strong>Running:</strong> The thread resumes execution.</li><li><strong>Terminated:</strong> The thread completes its execution.</li></ul>
            <p>This is a simplified example, and in real-world scenarios, the thread lifecycle may involve more states and complexities, depending on the application's requirements.</p>

            <div class='subhead1'>Thread Synchronization</div>
            <p>When multiple threads are accessing shared resources, it's essential to synchronize their execution to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency. Python provides synchronization primitives like Locks, Semaphores, and Conditions to achieve this.</p>
            <p>Here's an example using the threading module in Python to demonstrate the use of a Lock for synchronization.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">import threading

shared_variable = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def update_shared_variable():
    global shared_variable
    for _ in range(100):
        with lock:
            shared_variable += 1

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=update_shared_variable)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=update_shared_variable)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Final shared variable value:", shared_variable)</code></pre>
            <button onClick=myFunction2()>Try it</button>
            <div class="subhead">Output</div>
            <div id="demo2" class="output">
                Click on try it to see output
            </div>
            <ul><li>In this example The <b>shared_variable</b> is a variable that both threads will try to increment in a loop.</li><li>The <b>lock</b> is a <b>threading.Lock</b> object used to synchronize access to the shared variable.</li><li>The <b>update_shared_variable</b> function increments the shared variable in a loop, and the <b>with lock</b> statement ensures that only one thread can execute this critical section at a time.</li></ul>
            <p>When you run this script, you'll observe that the final value of the shared variable is the sum of the increments performed by both threads. Without the lock, the final value could be incorrect due to race conditions.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that the use of locks introduces some overhead, and careful consideration is needed to strike a balance between thread safety and performance.</p>
            <p>Other synchronization primitives, such as Semaphores, Conditions, and Events, can also be used depending on the specific requirements of your application. The choice of synchronization mechanism depends on the complexity of the synchronization needed and the nature of the shared resources.</p>

            <div class='subhead1'>Daemon Threads</div>
            <p>In Python, a daemon thread is a thread that runs in the background and is abruptly terminated when the program exits, regardless of whether it has completed its work or not. Daemon threads are useful for tasks that don't require the main program to wait for their completion. </p>
            <p>Here's an example using the threading module to illustrate daemon threads.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">import threading
import time

def daemon_thread_function():
    while True:
        print("Daemon thread is running...")
        time.sleep(1)

# Create a daemon thread
daemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=daemon_thread_function)
daemon_thread.daemon = True  # Set the thread as a daemon

# Start the daemon thread
daemon_thread.start()

# The main thread continues its work
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Main thread: {i}")
    time.sleep(1)

print("Main thread exits, and daemon thread is terminated")</code></pre>
            <button onClick=myFunction3()>Try it</button>
            <div class="subhead">Output</div>
            <div id="demo3" class="output">
                Click on try it to see output
            </div>
            <ul><li>In this example <b>daemon_thread_function</b> is a simple function that runs in an infinite loop, printing a message and sleeping for 1 second in each iteration.</li><li>A thread, <b>daemon_thread</b>, is created with this function as its target.</li><li>The <b>daemon</b> attribute of the thread is set to <b>True</b>, making it a daemon thread.</li><li>The daemon thread is started, and the main thread continues its work in parallel.</li></ul>
            <p>When you run this script, you'll see that the daemon thread continues running even after the main thread exits. However, if you didn't set the daemon attribute to True, the program would wait for the daemon thread to complete before exiting.</p>
            <p>Daemon threads are commonly used for tasks such as monitoring, cleanup, or background processing, where it's acceptable for the thread to be abruptly terminated when the main program exits. Keep in mind that daemon threads may not perform cleanup actions or release resources explicitly when they are terminated. If cleanup is necessary, it's often better to use non-daemon threads and ensure they are properly joined before the program exits.</p>

            <div class='subhead1'>Thread Local Data</div>
            <p>Thread-local data in Python allows you to have data that is specific to each thread. The threading module provides the local class, which is used to create thread-local data.</p>
            <p>Here's an example to illustrate thread-local data.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">import threading

thread_local_data = threading.local()

def set_thread_local_variable(value):
    thread_local_data.value = value
    print(f"{threading.current_thread().name}: Set thread-local variable to {value}")

def get_thread_local_variable():
    value = getattr(thread_local_data, 'value', None)
    print(f"{threading.current_thread().name}: Got thread-local variable: {value}")

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=set_thread_local_variable, args=(42,), name="Thread 1")
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=get_thread_local_variable, name="Thread 2")

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()</code></pre>
            <button onClick=myFunction4()>Try it</button>
            <div class="subhead">Output</div>
            <div id="demo4" class="output">
                Click on try it to see output
            </div>
            <ul><li>In this example The <b>thread_local_data</b> object is an instance of <b>threading.local()</b>, which creates a thread-local storage object.</li><li>The <b>set_thread_local_variable</b> function sets a thread-local variable (<b>value</b>) for the current thread.</li><li>The <b>get_thread_local_variable</b> function retrieves and prints the thread-local variable for the current thread.</li></ul>
            <p>Each thread has its own instance of the thread_local_data object, and modifications to the thread-local variable in one thread do not affect the value seen by other threads.</p>
            <p>Thread-local data is useful when you want to associate data with a thread without the risk of interference from other threads. It's particularly handy in situations where global variables might lead to race conditions or unintended shared state between threads.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In summary, Python threads provide a way to implement concurrent execution in your programs, but due to the Global Interpreter Lock, they might not be suitable for all types of tasks. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to consider using processes instead of threads for better parallelism.</p>
