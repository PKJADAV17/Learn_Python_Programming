<p>Lists are similar to arrays in C. However; the list can contain
data of different types. The items stored in the list are separated
with a comma (,) and enclosed within square brackets [].</p>
<p>We can use slice [:] operators to access the data of the list. The
concatenation operator (+) and repetition operator (*) works with
the list in the same way as they were working with the strings.
