              <ul><li><strong>Readability:</strong>
                Python's syntax is designed to be clear and readable, making it easy for beginners to learn and understand. The use of indentation (whitespace) instead of curly braces or keywords for block structures contributes to its clean and organized appearance.</li><li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong>
                    Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. This makes development and debugging more straightforward compared to languages that need to be compiled.</li><li><strong>General-Purpose:</strong>
                    Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for a wide variety of applications. It's used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong>
                    Python uses dynamic typing, which means you don't have to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter automatically determines the type during runtime.</li><li><strong>Large Standard Library:</strong>
                    Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules and packages for a wide range of tasks, from working with files to handling network protocols, web development, and more. This reduces the need for external libraries in many cases.</li><li><strong>Community and Ecosystem:</strong>
                    Python has a large and active community. This means there are plenty of resources, documentation, and third-party libraries available. Popular libraries and frameworks like NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, and PyTorch contribute to Python's popularity in specific domains.</li><li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong>
                    Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), facilitating the creation and organization of code through the use of classes and objects.</li><li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong>
                    Python is a cross-platform language, meaning you can write code on one operating system and run it on another with little or no modification.</li></ul>
            <p>Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
            <p>This one-liner demonstrates the simplicity and readability that Python is known for. If you have Python installed, you can save this code in a file with a .py extension and run it using the command python filename.py.</p>
            <p>Python has many more features and capabilities. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers a versatile and powerful platform for a wide range of applications.</p>
