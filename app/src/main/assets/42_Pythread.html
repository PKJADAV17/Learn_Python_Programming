            <h1 class="head">Python Thread Programming</h1>
            <p>In Python, a thread refers to a lightweight sub-process that runs independently and concurrently with other threads within the same program. Threads are a way to achieve parallelism and can be used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Python provides a built-in module called threading that allows you to work with threads.</p>
