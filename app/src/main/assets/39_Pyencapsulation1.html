        <ul><li><strong>Public, Private, and Protected Attributes:</strong><ul><li><strong>Public:</strong> By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public, meaning they can be accessed from outside the class.</li><li><strong>Private:</strong> You can use a double underscore (<code>__</code>) prefix to make an attribute or method private. For example, <code>__variable</code> or <code>__method()</code>. Private members are not accessible from outside the class.</li><li><strong>Protected:</strong> Attributes or methods with a single underscore (<code>_</code>) prefix are considered protected. While they can be accessed from outside the class, it is a convention that they should be treated as if they were private. However, Python does not enforce this, and it's more of a naming convention.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Accessing Encapsulated Members:</strong><ul><li>Public members can be accessed directly: <code>obj.public_member</code>.</li><li>Private members can be accessed within the class itself, but attempting to access them from outside the class will result in an <code>AttributeError</code>.</li><li>Protected members follow a similar pattern as private members but are often accessible from outside the class, although this is discouraged.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Getter and Setter Methods:</strong><ul><li>To provide controlled access to private members, classes often define getter and setter methods.</li><li>A getter method retrieves the value of a private member, while a setter method allows you to modify its value.</li></ul></li></ul>
            <p>Here's a simple example to illustrate encapsulation in Python.</p>
            <b class="example">Example </b>
            <pre><code class="language-python line-numbers">class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__speed = 0  

    def accelerate(self):
        self.__speed += 5

    def get_speed(self):  
        return self.__speed

    def set_speed(self, speed):
        if speed >= 0:
            self.__speed = speed

my_car = Car()
my_car.accelerate()
print(my_car.get_speed())  
my_car.set_speed(20)       
print(my_car.get_speed())</code></pre>
            <button onClick=myFunction()>Try it</button>
            <div class="subhead">Output</div>
            <div id="demo" class="output">
                Click on try it to see output
            </div>
            <p>In this example, __speed is a private attribute, and its value is controlled through getter and setter methods. This encapsulation helps in maintaining control over the internal state of the Car class.</p>
