<div class="head">Socket Programming</div>
<p>Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.
</p>
<p>Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.
</p>
<p>Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. Socket programming is started by importing the socket library and making a simple socket.
