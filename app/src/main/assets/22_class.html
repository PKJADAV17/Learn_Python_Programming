<div class="head">Python Class and Object</div>
<p>Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stress on objects. </p>
<p>Object is simply a collection of variables and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object. 
</p>
<p>We can think of class as a sketch of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.
