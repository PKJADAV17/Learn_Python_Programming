<div class="head">Merge Sort</div>
<p>Merge Sort follows the rule of Divide and Conquer. In merge sort the unsorted list is divided into N sublists, each having one element, because a list consisting of one element is always sorted. Then, it repeatedly merges these sublists, to produce new sorted sublists, and in the end, only one sorted list is produced.
