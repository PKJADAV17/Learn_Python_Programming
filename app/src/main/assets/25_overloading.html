<div class="head">Overloading</div>
<p>Overloading, in the context of programming, refers to the ability of a function or an operator to behave in different ways depending on the parameters that are passed to the function, or the operands that the operator acts on.
</p>
<p>Overloading a method fosters reusability. For instance, instead of writing multiple methods that differ only slightly, we can write one method and overload it. Overloading also improves code clarity and eliminates complexity.
