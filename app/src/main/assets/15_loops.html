<p>In any programming language, loops are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.
</p>
<p>A sequence of statements is executed until a specified condition is true. This sequence of statements to be executed is kept inside the Loop body. After every execution of loop body, condition is verified, and if it is found to be true the loop body is executed again. When the condition check returns false, the loop body is not executed.
</p>
<p>There are two types of loops in Python that is given below.</p>
