<div class="head">Compiler and Interpreter</div>
<p>Compiler and Interpreter are two different ways to execute a
program written in a programming or scripting language.</p>
<p>A <b class="element">compiler</b> takes entire program and converts it into object
code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also
refereed as binary code and can be directly executed by the
machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming
languages are C and C++.
</p>
<p>An <b class="element">Interpreter</b> directly executes instructions written in a
programming or scripting language without previously converting
them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted
languages are Perl, Python and Matlab.</p>
